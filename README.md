# Machine Learning Fall 2022 Final Project

## Project Description
We are trying to solve the problem of automating hate speech and offensive language detection.

Hate speeches are common on social media, and it would be easier for such speeches to be regulated if some program can automatically detect them. The problem is similar to the language recognition in  hw3  lab in that we take a natural language input as a sequence, and train a model to predict some labels associated with such input sequence. The unique part of this task is that hate speech/offensive language is sometimes hard to detect because it really depends on the context the language is used. By automating hate speech and offensive language detection, we could contribute to making a more healthy internet environment.
